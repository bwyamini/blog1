A fruit that’s often treated as a vegetable, the tomato in Indian food is used in most preparations, its benefits far surpassing its usage.

<div>
 <strong>Decreases stroke risk</strong><br/>
Blood clotting should occur when needed, but excessive blood clotting leads to a snowball effect resulting in arterial damage and stroke. 75% of people older than 65 years old experience a stroke in their time. Luckily, lycopene has anti-inflammatory and anti-clotting properties to prevent and digest plaque build-up.</div>
<div>
<strong>Reduces blood pressure</strong><br/>
High blood pressure suggests long-term impairment in heart health. Especially if you have diabetes, hypertension, and/or a history of cardiovascular disease. A study found that tomato consumption helps lower blood pressure to a healthy range in type II diabetic people.</div>
<div>
<strong>Maintains glucose levels</strong><br/>
Prolonged blood sugar levels hurt major organs such as the brain and kidneys. If you’re battling diabetes, eating more tomatoes is a great way to incorporate more low glycemic foods into your diet to stabilize high blood glucose.</div>

Daily ingestion of tomatoes is associated with treating depression and Alzheimer's disease. In a prospective study, researchers listed tomatoes as a beneficial fruit to enhance the nutritional diversity of your diet. Tomatoes add vitamins B and E, which can limit neural degeneration.</div>

<strong>Good for eye health</strong><br/>
Beta-carotene and lycopene are readily available in tomatoes and serve a dual function as an antioxidant and vitamin A precursor. These carotenoids aid in the filtration of harmful light entering the eyes.</div>

<strong>Supports bone health</strong><br/>
Tomatoes have two essential minerals for humans. Magnesium functions as a cofactor for calcitonin, which is a hormone that redirects calcium from the blood into bones. Potassium is another important mineral that prevents metabolic acidosis of bones, which prevents calcium loss as you age.</div>
<div>
<strong>Reduces the risk of birth defects</strong><br/>
During pregnancy, It is recommended to increase one’s intake of vitamins. This prevents the risk of both birth complications and defects. Scientists from the University of Florida developed a way to engineer folate-dense tomatoes, which in turn can protect the mother and fetus from developmental problems. Folic acid is a B vitamin that is used to supplement pregnancy for protection against neural tube defects.</div>
