       <div>Compared with conventional agriculture, organic farming uses fewer pesticides, reduces soil erosion, decreases nitrate leaching into groundwater and surface water, and recycles animal wastes back into the farm. These benefits are counterbalanced by higher food costs for consumers and generally lower yields.</div>
       <div>Organic Farming in India is getting popularity every year and farmers/individuals/retired persons from different states are successfully adopting organic farming techniques in and earning decent revenues, at the same time adding value in maintaining a healthy ecosystem on the whole. </div>
       <div>It relies on ecologically balanced agricultural principles like crop rotation, green manure, organic waste, biological pest control, mineral and rock additives. Organic farming makes use of pesticides and fertilizers if they are considered natural and avoids the use of various petrochemical fertilizers and pesticides.</div>
       <div><strong>Why Organic? </strong></div>
       <div>
         <strong>1.Keep chemicals out of our bodies</strong><br/>
         Many foods have residues of poisonous chemicals used as pesticides in their production. Many systemic pesticides cannot be removed by washing. Pesticides pose serious health risks. Numerous studies show that pesticides can increase the risk of cancer, adversely affect the nervous and endocrine systems and decrease fertility.</div>
        <div>
          <strong>2.	Protect future generations</strong><br/> 
          Before a mother first breastfeeds her new born, the toxic risk from pesticides has already begun. Studies show that unborn babies are exposed to hundreds of harmful chemicals in-utero. Organically grown food is safe food, free from the dangers of poisons and chemicals, which is especially important for children, who have a lower body weight than adults and developing systems and brains.</div>
        <div>
          <strong>3.	Avoid hormones, antibiotics and drugs in animal products</strong><br/>
           Dairy cows and meat animals are routinely injected with growth hormones and antibiotics. These get passed into the milk /meat we consume and harm the health, especially of children.</div>
          <div>
            <strong> 4.	Better Nutrition, Better Taste</strong><br/>
             Fresh organic produce contains more vitamins, minerals, enzymes and antioxidants than chemically produced food. Organic foods are also consistently judged tastier.</div>
        <div>
          <strong>5.	Reduce Environmental Pollution</strong><br/>
           Chemical agriculture wreaks havoc on the environment. Pesticides seep into groundwater, and can cause loss of aquatic life, birds and wildlife. Chemical fertilizer dependency has taken a toll on the natural health of the soil.</div>
          <div>
            <strong> 6.	Support Farmer’s Livelihoods</strong><br/>
            Organic farming reduces dependency on external inputs like seeds, fertilizers and pesticides. Instead they are produced from cow dung, bio-mass, beneficial herbs and leaves. Dependence on expensive inputs purchased from outside leads to financial distress of farmers.</div>
            <div>
              <strong> 7.	Protect the health of farmers</strong><br/>
               Close and continuous contact with agricultural poisons makes farmers more susceptible to cancer, respiratory problems and other major diseases. India’s farmers are exposed to numerous pesticides that are banned in developed countries. Many farmers turn to organic methods after experiencing the ill-effects of pesticides. Studies have shown some of the pesticides induce suicidal tendency.</div>
              <div>
                <strong> 8.	Promote native seed diversity</strong><br/>
                 Traditional seeds developed by Indian farmers are naturally pest-resistant, nutritious and suited to local conditions. Chemical farming promotes the use of Hybrid non-native seeds.</div>
                <div>
                  <strong>9.	Avoid eating Genetically Modified (GM) food</strong><br/>
                   Organic standards do not allow any genetically modified seeds and inputs. GM foods, if approved for the market in India, cannot be distinguished from other foods. Going organic is the sure way to know your foods are free of GMOs.</div>
                  <div>
                    <strong>10.	Promote Biodiversity</strong><br/>
                     Visit an organic farm and you’ll notice something: a buzz of animal, bird and insect activity. Native plants and birds return usually after the first season of organic practices.</div>
