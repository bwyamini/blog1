              </strong><br/>
<div>We all know we should be eating a diet consisting of colorful, varied fruit and vegetables. Leafy green vegetables provide a range of health benefits as part of a balanced diet. Green veg is high in antioxidants, minerals, fiber, and much more. They keep you hydrated and can even make you feel happier.</div><br/>
<div>
  <strong> 1) High in Antioxidants</strong><br/>

  Green vegetables are rich in vitamin A – good for building your body’s natural defenses, vitamin C for healthy skin and bones, and vitamin K to help your body heal itself quickly when necessary. In addition to these vitamins, beautiful green veg is also rich in potassium and iron.</div>
<div>
  <strong>2) Full of Minerals</strong><br/>
   Green leafy vegetables, particularly spinach, are known for being high in magnesium. Magnesium is a mineral necessary for maintaining muscle health, as well as bone formation – helping the absorption of calcium.</div>
<div>
  <strong>3) A Natural Source of Fibre</strong><br/>
 Greens are a brilliant source of natural fiber, aiding digestion and slowing the rate at which your body absorbs sugar. This prevents sharp rises in blood glucose.</div>
<div>
  <strong>4) Improves Your Metabolism</strong><br/>
  As leafy, crunchy fresh greens are high in iron and fiber, they naturally improve our metabolism and keep the production of our red blood cells at a healthy rate. So, pile your plate high!</div>
<div>
  <strong>5) Makes You Feel Fuller for Longer</strong><br/>
As high fiber vegetables, greens are the perfect solution for rumbling stomachs. The more you eat, the less likely you are to reach for the junk in the cupboard!</div>

<div>
  <strong>6) Protects Your Eyes</strong><br/>
  As mentioned previously, Lutein and zeaxanthin, plant pigments found in dark green leafy vegetables are said to have beneficial effects on your eyes’ macular pigment levels when eating at least 10mg a day.</div>
<div>
  <strong>7) Edible Sun Protection</strong><br/>
  Now don’t go throwing away your sunscreen just yet – we’re not saying your green veg is a substitute! However, it is said to increase your body’s natural defenses against sun damage and even repair, thanks to your green vegetables’ vitamin content, folic acid, and beta-carotene.</div>
<div>
  <strong>8) Lifts Your Mood</strong><br/>
  Your green leafy vegetables are a great source of folate, and as this contributes to serotonin production, you may find your mood lifting.</div>
<div>
  <strong>9) Keeps You Hydrated</strong><br/>
   Finally, green vegetables contain a lot of water, which means adding them to your plate helps to keep you hydrated, maintaining healthy skin and hair.</div>
<div>
  <strong>10) Memory prolongers</strong><br/>
   One study of adults with an average age of 81 found those who ate one to two daily servings of green leafy vegetables had the cognitive function of a person 11 years younger, compared with those who avoided them. This was probably due to the folate, beta-carotene, and vitamin K that leafy greens contain.</div>
